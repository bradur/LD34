Theme : Two Buttons /& Growing

Title : Sticky Stuff

Two buttons (+ arrow keys?)
- Left Button turns left
- Right Button turns right

Two phases (each level):

 Phase1
  - Collectable objects are being sent from top, left, right
  - Powerups? What kind?
  - Player can turn the character
  - Objects grow that part of the character that collides with the collectable objects

 Phase2
  - Negative objects are being sent from top, left, right
  - Player can turn the character
  - Player can take a few hits?
  - The parts that take hits shrink?

 End
  - Score is calculated on finish, more parts = more score
  - Size is kept between levels? And game zooms out?

UI
- Some acceleration to buttons (takes time to start, stop)
- Show some sort of "band" that shows current rotation speed (near the character)
