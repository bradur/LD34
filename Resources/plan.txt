Theme : Two Buttons /& Growing

Title : Sticky Stuff

Two buttons (+ arrow keys?)
- Left Button turns left
- Right Button turns right

Game:
  - Collectable objects fall towards the player
  - Player can turn around but not move
  - Objects become a part of the character on collision
  - The object is to become big enough to reach next level
    (gauge this somehow)
  - Game zooms out when going to next level

UI
- Some acceleration to buttons (takes time to start, stop)
- Show some sort of "band" that shows current rotation speed (near the character)

TODO:
- better collision sounds
- more shapes
- level progression + score
- retry-button
- more sounds:
    * next level blob
    * come into view
    * button
    * turn
